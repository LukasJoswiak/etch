## Installation

To install `etch`, clone the repository into the `themes` folder in the root of your site.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:LukasJoswiak/etch.git themes/etch
```

Then, use the theme to generate your site.

```
$ hugo server -t etch
```

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/wiki) to learn about more options.

***Note**: if you are using Netlify to host your site, you must [add Etch as a submodule](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/#use-hugo-themes-with-netlify) instead of cloning.*
